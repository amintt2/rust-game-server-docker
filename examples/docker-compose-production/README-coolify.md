# Deploying Rust Game Server with Coolify

This directory contains a Docker Compose configuration that is optimized for deployment on Coolify.

## Important Modifications for Coolify

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - `SERVER_NAME`: Name of your Rust server (default: RustServer)
   - `RCON_PASSWORD`: Password for RCON access (automatically generated by Coolify if not specified)
   - `SERVICE_FQDN_RUSTSERVER`: Automatically generated FQDN by Coolify

2. **Storage:**
   - Server data is stored in a named volume
   - Logs are stored in a local directory that will be created by Coolify

3. **Traefik Integration:**
   - Labels have been added for Traefik integration
   - The server will be accessible via the auto-generated FQDN

## Deployment Instructions

1. In Coolify, create a new "Docker Compose" resource
2. Connect to your Git repository or upload this compose file directly
3. Make sure to set "Connect to Predefined Network" if you need to connect to other resources
4. Deploy the resource

## Notes

- Container names are managed by Coolify
- RCON password is automatically generated if not specified
- Coolify will create the necessary directories for logs

## Custom Docker Options

If needed, you can add custom Docker options in the Coolify UI, such as:
```
--ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000
```
